# Locking Timeline
## Connecting with firebase

So wanted to try to make a locking timeline with a firebase connection I´ve worked with this locally but going to push it to github

### started with this idea years ago

I had this Idea in 2009-2010 but dident have and knowledge of programming or webdevelopment back then

Now with my remake of the lockerlegends page that you can find here https://www.lockerlegends.org
I´ve desided to start building this and in near future try to make hosted version online

the idea is first to have the locking time line from the 70´s

Then add a feature where people can connect and add to a separeta timeline with history from other places then the origin which is from LA

Ill add when I get further down the project
